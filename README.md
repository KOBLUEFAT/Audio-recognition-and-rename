Audio recognition and renaming with content. Audio recognition is performed using Azure's Speech Services API. Please enter your API key and region. The audio format must be in PLC or MAV format. Gender classification is not perfect and requires training the model with a large number of audio samples. I trained the model myself with tens of thousands of male and female audio samples from the internet, but the results were poor.
